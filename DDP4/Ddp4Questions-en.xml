    <question>habitual: the situation is customary or usual, repeated on different occasion over a period of time. English 'used to' is past habitual; English 'Nancy sings' is present habitual.</question>

    <question>subordinating: Often there are special verb forms or morphemes associated with the verb that occur obligatorily in subordinate clauses of certain types. The extent to which such morphemes can be said to have "meaning" varies, since they often co-occur with other markers of subordination. Their function is primarily to signal the type of subordinate clause.</question>
    <question>Complement clauses: A main verb may take as its direct object a clause. These are often referred to as "Noun clauses" or "Noun complements". The verb form of the subordinate clause is usually determined by the semantics of the main verb, so in this case, our meaning labels will just refer to the context. If a verb form occurs in the complements to words of thinking and believing, the meaning label will be complement to words of thinking and believing.</question>

  <semantic-domain guid="IF858278A-2727-4403-9CF0-565CDECECB1E" id="9.6.2.8 Condition">
    <question>Conditional sentences: Conditional sentences consist of two clauses, the 'if'-clause or protasis (which is a subordinate clause) and the 'then'-clause or apodosis (which is the main clause). Both of these clauses may take special verb forms. (Interestingly enough, they sometime both take the same special verb forms.)</question>
    <question>There are at least three types of conditional sentences. (Labels, explanations, and examples from Li and Thompson 1981): [Li, Charles N., and Sandra A. Thompson. 1981. Mandarin Chinese: A functional reference grammar. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press.]</question>
    <question>reality condition: a conditional relation between two propositions referring to the so-called real world: 'If you see my sister, you will know that she is pregnant'.</question>
    <question>hypothetical: the situation is unreal or imagined, but one that could be true: 'If we moved, we could have a garden'.</question>
    <question>counterfactual: the proposition describes an unreal or imagined situation that could have been true but was not: 'If you had taken algebra, you would know this formula' (but you did not).</question>
    <question>The verb forms that occur in these sentences will be coded according to the type of sentence, and according to which clause of the sentence they occur in.</question>
    <question>Example: the English 'had' + past participle would be coded as:</question>
    <question>meaning label: protasis</question>
    <question>meaning label: counterfactual</question>
    <question>Since the conjunction 'if' obligatorily occurs in the protasis, there will also be the following:</question>
    <question>Co-occurrence restriction: 'if'</question>
    <question>This indicates that a morpheme meaning 'if' obligatorily occurs in the protasis. If no such morpheme is necessary, then there will be no co-occurrence restriction.</question>
